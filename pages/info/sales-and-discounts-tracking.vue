            <h3 class="text-2xl mb-4">My Passion for Online Shopping</h3>
            <p class="leading-8 text-stone-400">I can spend hours, or should I say days, scrolling through Amazon's product
                listings. From tech gadgets to kitchen appliances, fashion items to books, it's all there. The thrill of
                discovering new things and reading reviews is part of what makes Amazon so exciting. But the more I shopped,
                the more I realized I was missing out on significant savings.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl my-4">The Overwhelming World of Amazon</h3>
            <p class="leading-8 text-stone-400">The vast selection on Amazon can be overwhelming. It's like being in a giant
                candy store with no idea where to start. I found myself adding items to my cart, only to remove them later
                because of the hefty price tag. There's nothing more disheartening than seeing an item you want to buy, but
                the price doesn't quite fit your budget.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl my-4">The Quest for Savings</h3>
            <p class="leading-8 text-stone-400">That's when my hunt for discounts began. I started looking for promo codes
                and waiting for sales events. It was a constant struggle to keep track of all the products I wanted and wait
                for the right moment to buy. It was time-consuming and, more often than not, futile.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl my-4">The Need for a Helping Hand</h3>
            <p class="leading-8 text-stone-400">Just when I was about to give up on being a smart shopper, I stumbled upon
                the Nicked Chrome Extension, my ultimate sales and discounts tracker. This nifty tool promised to make my
                life easier and help me save money – something any Amazon shopper would appreciate.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl my-4">How It Works and What It Tracks</h3>

                watchlist. You can monitor historical price changes and set up notifications for price drops. It takes the
                hassle out of manually checking and comparing prices.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl mb-4">Setting Up Your Tracker Account</h3>
            <p class="leading-8 text-stone-400">Getting started is a breeze. You submit your email, creating an account
                (don't worry, we only send notifications when your tracked products go on sale) and install the browser
                extension. It's all user-friendly, and you'll be up and running in no time.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl my-4">Adding Products to Your Watchlist</h3>
            <p class="leading-8 text-stone-400">Once you have the extension, start adding products to your watchlist. You
                can do this by viewing amazon product listings, and clicking the "Track Sales" button right under the normal
                buy button. Clicking the button again will disable tracking for this item. Making Nicked flexible and easy
                to use.</p>

                Nicked</h2>
            <h3 class="text-2xl mb-4">Getting Notified About Price Drops</h3>
            <p class="leading-8 text-stone-400">One of the best features of the Nicked - your ultimate sales and discounts
                tracker is the ability to set up price drop notifications. Imagine you're eyeing a smartphone, and it's on
                your watchlist. The moment the price goes down, you receive an email. It's like having a personal shopper
                always on the lookout for you.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl my-4">Historical Price Tracking</h3>
            <p class="leading-8 text-stone-400">Another cool feature is the historical price tracking. You can see how the
                price of a product has changed over time. This helps you identify the best time to buy. I remember wanting
                to buy a DSLR camera, and this feature helped me realize that it tends to go on sale during the holiday
                season.</p>
